    title: "What is a Unit?",
    content: `A unit in physics is a way to measure a quantity. Remember how we talked about quantities in physics, like how fast something is moving or how heavy it is? Well, units help us to measure those quantities.

    Just like how we use inches to measure how tall something is or how many toys we can fit into a box, in physics, we use units to measure things like distance, time, and temperature.
    
    For example, if we want to measure how far we can jump, we might use a unit called meters. Or if we want to measure how hot it is outside, we might use a unit called degrees Celsius.
    
    So, basically, a unit in physics is a way to measure a quantity, like how heavy or how hot something is, using a specific type of measurement.`
